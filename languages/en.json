Ever since I was a kid, I've always been curious to learn how things work - I liked to take things apart and, of course, I loved playing with Lego. This, together with my love for video games, naturally resulted in my love for computing and, consequently, my bachelor's degree. Today I work as a programmer and I still spend my free time playing games, but I also have a passion for music and books.<br> I was once told that it is possible to get to know a person better based on their tastes.
